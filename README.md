This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of "VitaGlyph: Vitalizing Artistic Typography with Flexible Dual-branch Diffusion Models".

Note: This project is unrelated to the original Vitaglyph (vitaglyph.com), an evolution/spacetime project by Greg. Please visit their site if you are looking for that work.

## ✨ News/TODO
- [x] Source code of Controllable Compositional Generation.
- [x] Source code of Semantic Typography
- [ ] Source code of Regional Decomposition
- [ ] Source code of whole pipeline and inference
- [ ] More results

## ⚙️ Run inference demo
1) Run the following command to get subject image and surrounding image.
``` shell

```
2) Run the following command to pre-process subject image and surrounding image.
``` shell
python SemTypo.py --resolution 1024 
```
3) Run the following command to get final results.
``` shell

```

<!-- You can change 'xN' to get arbitrary frame rates results. The reuslts are saved in the folder './output'. -->
